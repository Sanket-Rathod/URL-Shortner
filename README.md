# URL-Shortner

Created a website to shorten the link when full url is inserted and shortened link button is clicked. Frameworks used are node.js, express.js. 
Shortened link, full url and number of clicks are stored in MongoDB database. Schema of database is described in file shortUrl.js
Unique shortened url is created using Base 62 hashing. With Base 62 hashing we can scale the short url application.
Table details are sorted with latest short URL inserted at top.
